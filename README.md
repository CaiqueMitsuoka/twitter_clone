# Twitter clone

Twitter clone for RailsGirls coaches.

Simple clone to teach some Rails fundamentals use cases.

What has been done:

1. Ran `rails new twitter_clone --skip-test --skip-coffee --skip-yarn --skip-turbolinks` to create the app and skip test, coffee, yarn and turbolinks.
2. Added devise with default configurations. You can see more [here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started).
3. Ran `rails generate devise user` to generate the user model with devise authentication.
4. Ran `rails generate scaffold tweet post:string user_id:integer`, see more about scaffolding [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.9/getting_started.html#creating-a-resource).
5. Added the relation of the tweet and user. On the User class added `has_many :tweets` and on Tweet class added `belongs_to :user`
6. Remove user_id from the form generated by the scaffold.
7. Added `TimelineController` and index view with a form for tweet and the timeline of the tweets.


Next step is add style to the views.

If you want to step back and create an app by yourself I suggest you follow [this](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial.
